# Dubai Public Libraries Showcase

A beautiful, interactive web application showcasing Dubai's public libraries managed by Dubai Culture & Arts Authority. This project demonstrates how to use open government register data to create engaging user experiences.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as an example implementation of [Dubai Culture's Public Libraries Register](https://www.dubaipulse.gov.ae/organisation/dubai-culture/service/dubai-culture-registers), encouraging developers to utilize open government data in their applications and services.

## 🔓 Request Access

To request access to the full private repository, please email the Data Leader at **Mohammed.Maree@dubaiculture.ae**. Access will be provided based on relevance to ongoing work with Dubai Culture open data.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Cards View**: Glassmorphic cards displaying library information with custom illustrations
- **Map View**: Interactive SVG map showing all library locations across Dubai
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers (works as a web app on phones)
- **Filter by Area**: Quick filtering to find libraries in specific neighborhoods
- **Direct Integration**: Get directions via Google Maps and book spaces via Electronic Services
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed for better developer experience

## 📊 Data Source

All library data is sourced from the official Dubai Culture registers:
**[Dubai Culture Public Libraries Register](https://www.dubaipulse.gov.ae/organisation/dubai-culture/service/dubai-culture-registers)**

The register provides:
- Library IDs
- Locations (latitude/longitude)
- Operating hours
- Contact information

## 🔧 Using Components in Your Project

This repository is designed to help developers integrate Dubai library information into their own applications. You can reuse components from this project:

### Reusing the Interactive Map

The map component (`src/components/LibraryMap.tsx`) uses Leaflet and OpenStreetMap - no API keys required.

**To integrate into your project:**
1. Copy `src/components/LibraryMap.tsx`
2. Copy `src/data/libraries.ts` and `src/types/library.ts`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install leaflet react-leaflet @types/leaflet`
4. Import and use: `<LibraryMap />`

### Reusing the Card View

The glassmorphic cards component (`src/components/LibraryGlassCards.tsx`) provides a beautiful visual display.

**To integrate into your project:**
1. Copy `src/components/LibraryGlassCards.tsx`
2. Copy `src/data/libraries.ts` and `src/types/library.ts`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install lucide-react`
4. Import and use: `<LibraryGlassCards />`

### Using Just the Data

If you only need the library data without UI components:

```typescript
import { libraries } from './data/libraries';

// Access all library information
libraries.forEach(library => {
  console.log(library.title, library.lat, library.lng);
});
```

### Customizing for Your Needs

- **Styling**: All components use Tailwind CSS - customize colors and styles easily
- **Data**: Update `src/data/libraries.ts` with additional fields from the register
- **Features**: Add filtering, search, or booking integration as needed

**Note:** This is open source (MIT License) - feel free to modify, extend, and use in commercial projects. We encourage innovation with government open data!
